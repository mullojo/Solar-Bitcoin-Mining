# Solar-Bitcoin-Mining

This project was created to more clearly demonstrate how Bitcoin Solar Mining accelerates the world's transition to sustainable energy.

A draft slide deck has been created to show 4 main concepts:

1. Solar energy generation has the greatest potential to solve the world's sustainable energy challenges
2. Solar Bitcoin mining, at any scale, rapidly pays for solar energy projects
3. New open innovations in this space, such as "Distributed Thin Solar Waste Mining", make solar mining more accessible to humanity
4. Proposing a large scale open source effort to advance Solar Bitcoin Mining & operation

See a low-res PDF copy of the slides here:

We're welcoming contributors & collaborators to advance the ideas here so that we can collectively make them a reality
